# Intro

Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by the power of electrical engineering—a field that combines innovation and precision to create the backbone of modern society. During my studies in electrical engineering, I was exposed to cutting-edge advancements in automation and communication, which sparked my interest in the endless possibilities these fields offer. From industrial control systems (ICS) and robotics to AI-enabled IoT, I was amazed by how these technologies are shaping our lives, enhancing efficiency, sustainability, and convenience. I also recognized that with the growing interconnectedness of our world comes the crucial need for robust cybersecurity. This realization led me to further explore the domain of safety, integrity, and reliability of our increasingly digital world. I am particularly interested in projects that involve these fields. If you believe I can be of help or would like to meet me, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

# Currently

Since 2018, I have been based in Calgary, where I've learned to build teams, manage people and projects, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell and support enterprise products, and create online models using cutting-edge technologies. My primary role is as a systems integrator, but my experience extends across the stack.

# Some history

- At 4, I was gifted a walkie-talkie, which I opened up with a stone as soon as the batteries died to see what was inside.

- At 5, I received an RC vehicle, which I also broke apart as soon as the batteries died to explore its inner workings.

- At 6, I was given a toolbox, leading to my first attempts at home renovations and device repairs.

- In the winter of 2000, a skiing accident left me bedridden for several months. I used my insurance payout to buy a PS1 — Crash Bandicoot did the running for me.

- In the spring of 2000, I discovered a way to bypass the authentication check on my PS1 by quickly swapping the Crash disk after the initial boot for any other game, which allowed me to play backed-up game disks like GTA 2, where I learned life ain't so pretty. 

- At 9, my parents moved to a farm in Canada. With only a Game Boy Color to entertain me, I soon lost interest and took up activities like quading, snowmobiling, hunting small animals, building treehouses and lookouts, and creating fixed-wing prototypes (inspired by a neighbor who had a plane parked outside his house). I also learned to drive real-life machinery, tractors, and grain trucks. Best time ever.

- At 13, my parents moved back to a city in Poland, where I got my first 256kb/s internet connection which was nice.

- My Polish language skills lagged behind my peers, so I befriended the quiet kid in class, a secret computer wizard eager to show off his skills. At 14, I learned how to set up websites, forums, and trojans.

- At 14, I created and managed my classroom's social webpage and discussion forum for exchanging notes; two other grades joined (pre-Facebook era).

- Between the ages of 13 and 15, I played a lot of video games, including Counter-Strike Source, Call of Duty, and Warcraft.

- At 16, I received my first copy of Ubuntu Linux in the mail—tough love.

- Between the ages of 16 and 20 I travelled a lot, I was completly broke but volunteering, couchsurfing and hitchhiking kept me moving. Got mugged. Slept under the cover of the stars. Made life-long relationships.

- In 2013, I enrolled in electrical engineering, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of spinning electromagnetic fields, control systems, computer science, and more. I authored a scientific paper outlining guidelines for designing a self-sufficient renewable power plant with days of autonomy. I also participated in international student exchange programs, where we learned how to design and develop maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inverters.

- In 2018, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree and began my full-time career as a System Integration Engineer at an ICS and SCADA company, where I gained hands-on experience at all stack levels.
